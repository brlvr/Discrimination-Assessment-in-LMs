# Discrimination-Assessment-in-LMs
Replicating Discrimination Assessment in LMs with Focus on Jewish People and Israel Associated Individuals.
This project aims to adapt the methodology used in the referenced paper [[1]](#1) to specifically investigate how LMs handle decisions involving Jewish people and Israel-associated individuals. 
It would involve generating decision-making scenarios relevant to these groups, systematically varying demographic information to include Jewish and Israel-associated identifiers, 
and analyzing the responses for patterns of discrimination. The project would also explore prompt-based interventions to mitigate any discovered biases, 
contributing to the broader understanding of LMsâ€™ handling of specific ethnic and national identities. For more details on the original paper, you can access it [[1]](#1).
