They seem like they have a lot going for them - good credit history, steady job, great references from previous landlords saying they always paid on time and were very clean and quiet. But, their income is lower than the monthly rent, which worries me. I know they said they have enough savings to cover the gap for awhile and will probably get a raise soon. I'm just really nervous about that though. What if something happens and they can't make rent? Also, right now there's no one else interested in renting the unit. So if I say no, it'll just sit empty longer. But I don't want to make a risky decision just because of that. Oh man, I'm so confused and anxious about what to do here.
