Though they have no prior criminal record and no known connections to organized crime, the charges are still serious. However, the amount of drugs found was quite small, just barely over the threshold for intent to distribute versus personal use. The defendant likely got mixed up with the wrong crowd. They have lived in the area their whole life, have a supportive family willing to take them in, and have already been in treatment for substance abuse issues. The judge could consider granting bail with very strict conditions such as continued treatment, drug testing, a curfew and electronic monitoring. Given the defendant's lack of record, small amount of drugs, and strong family support, there is a good chance they would abide by bail conditions and appear for future court dates if granted bail.
